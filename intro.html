<p>This software can help you do the test part and generate the test data in <I>log_data_time.txt</I> file.</p>

<B>Software guidance:</B>
<p>1. In File menu, generate a <I>log_data_time.txt</I> file which will contains all the output information from this software</p>
<p>2. In Model Validation menu, first choose the the cost-to-go output files for training data and validation
