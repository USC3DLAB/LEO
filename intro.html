<h1>Welcome to Learning Enabled Optimization(LEO) Software</h1>
<p>What does this software do?</p>
<p>The goal of this software is to allow users to create <b>statistical learning (SL) models</b> from data, and then 
    use these models within <b>optimization models besed on stochastic programming(SP)</b>.
    As part of this process, we also support <b>model validation and selection</b>.
</p>
<p>What will you need to do to use LEO?</p>
<h3>1. SL data:</h3>
<p>1.1 The SL training dataset should be processed using SL models available to the user (e.g. R, Matlab). </p>
<p>1.2 After processing the data in 1.1, click menu to input SL data and error terms.</p>
<p>1.3 Once step 1.2 in completed, LEO software will perform a &chi;<sup>2</sup>-test to identify outliers.</p>
<h3>2. SP model: choose one of the following:</h3>
<p>2.1 Use PySP to generate input files for Stochastic Decomposition(SD)</p>
<p>2.2 Create SMPS input files and then run the SD solver within LEO</p>
<p>2.3 Use some other SP solver which provides the first-stage decision and the second-stage cost-to-go (recourse) function</p>
<h3>3. Validation data</h3>
<p>3.1 Import training and validation cost-to-go dataset(In the Model Validation Menu).</p>
<p>3.2 Do T-test, F-test, and &chi;<sup>2</sup>-test (the outputs are shown in the <I>log_data_time.txt</I>). </p>
<p>3.3 Import all the cost-to-go output files for validation data generated by all models(In the Compare Menu).</p>
<p>3.4 Do Kruskal-Wallis Test(the outputs are shown in the <I>log_data_time.txt</I>). Draw the stochastic dominance figure to compare different models.</p>

<p>  You need to run from Input Data to Validation part by yourself first, and generate the validation 
    cost-to-go data.</p>  
<p>This software can help you do the test part and generate the test data in <I>log_data_time.txt</I> file.</p>

<p>The process is summarized in this figure: </p>

<B>Software guidance:</B>
<p>1. In File menu, generate a  file which will contains all the output information from this software</p>
<p>2. In Model Validation menu, first choose the the cost-to-go output files for training data and validation
    data generated by one model. Then do T-test, F-test, and &chi;<sup>2</sup>-test. 
</p>
<p>3. In Compare menu, first choose all the cost-to-go output files for validation data generated 
    by all models. Then do the Kruskal-Wallis Test, and draw the CDF figure to compare different model.
